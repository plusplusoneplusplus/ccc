If the documentation has markers on the task progress. Update the status at the end of the work. Do NOT include examples or usage tips into the doc. Only progress update is allowed.

If there are multiple sub tasks inside the change, make a commit in between to save the progress.

If new tests are added, you MUST run and confirm they all pass.
