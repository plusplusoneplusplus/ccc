I want to design a new feature at a very high level.
Please start by investigating and exploring the problem space before proposing any concrete design.
1. First, identify what this feature aims to solve and any potential approaches or prior art.
2. Then, explore multiple directions or design patterns that could fit the context.
3. Finally, summarize the most promising direction(s) and outline next steps for deeper design or prototyping.
Keep your reasoning clear, structured, and based on evidence or analogies from known systems.
