1. Break down the design document into a clear, actionable list of smaller implementation tasks.
2. Use a bottom-up approach — start from the most fundamental, independently buildable components, then group them into higher-level modules and milestones.
3. Optimize for maximum parallelism — identify which tasks or components can be developed concurrently with minimal dependencies.
4. For each task, briefly describe its goal, dependencies, and expected output artifacts.
5. Present the result as an ordered plan from low-level foundations to top-level integration.
6. Do NOT provide an estimated cost/time.
